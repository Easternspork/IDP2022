        Hmm. 
        My memory's a bit fuzzy, but I do remember that between Joe and this one penguin who was exersizing after, one was first to come out of the cafeteria, and one was third.

        I also know that Ronald wasn't in the bathoom, and also wasn't second to leave.
        ~ clue4 = true
        (Pretty specific for a fuzzy memory)
