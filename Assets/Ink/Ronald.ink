Things weren't the same after the Chicken Coup Oâ€™ 43.
    * [What happened?]
        All them human leaders got overthrown and the Barnyard Age started.
        Things were goin fine till that darn Bos empire took over.
            * * [Bos empire?]
                Same folk as those cows throwin us into this rothole.
                 -> fin
    * [Chicken coup?]
        Some of those cluckers had enough of humans tellin em' what to do and decided to put matters into their own feathers.
        Thing is, they didn't expect those darn bovines to take advantage of the situation.
            * * [The same ones that put us in here?]
                That's right. Poor chickens got crushed.
                Both figuratively and figuratively.
                 -> fin
            * * [Darn bovines?]
                Them cows throwing us in jail also took over the dang government. Those megolomaniacs don't know where to stop.
                -> fin

Those cows are pumping methane into the air like it's nothing. 
    * [Why?]
        Heck if I know. Maybe they wanted to force us off of our lands, the ice caps, or keep us busy fighting civil wars over food. Darn scumbag cows, usin their farts to warm the planet like that.
        -> END
    * [What?]
        Them farts are no joke. Its sad to think that this prison is favorable to fighting over our melting territory. The air's heatin up cause of that gas.
        -> END
